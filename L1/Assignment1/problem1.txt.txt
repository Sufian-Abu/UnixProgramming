HOME=/home/likewise-open/BRACU/12101064
Indicates the home directory of the current user: the default argument for the cd built-in command.

PATH=/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games

1g)

 the scripts directory is not in the PATH, and . (the current directory) is not in the PATH either, so we can activate the script like this: ./hw1.sh

1h)

nano ~/.bash_profile

export PATH=$PATH:.

source ~/.bash_profile

Single quotes treat their contents literally
BRACU12101064@ub40103pc07z:~$ mkdir 'whoami'
BRACU12101064@ub40103pc07z:~$ echo 'whoami'
whoami


Backquotes cause their contents to be evaluated as a com-
mand; the contents are then replaced by the standard output
of the command:
BRACU12101064@ub40103pc07z:~$ mkdir `whoami`
BRACU12101064@ub40103pc07z:~$ echo `whoami`
BRACU12101064

/home/likewise-open/BRACU/12101064/hw1/pb1/dog.txt

grep command search for lines containing "dog" in all the .txt file in /hw1/pb1 directory. the backqoute evaluates the command.
BRACU12101064@ub40103pc07z:/$ grep dog `ls ~/hw1/pb1/*.txt`
/home/likewise-open/BRACU/12101064/hw1/pb1/animals.txt:dog 
/home/likewise-open/BRACU/12101064/hw1/pb1/animals.txt:dog again
